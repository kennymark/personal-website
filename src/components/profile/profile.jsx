I am primarily a front-end developer but I have built back-end solutions in Node and ExpressJs. I have worked on several projects including this website. I also develop and design mobile apps with React Native.

            <p> Software development aside, I am also heavily invested in the creation and nurturing of ideas that are used by the masses. I incline to be entrepreneurial at times and product design would be an area I would love to explore and competent at. I see beyond code and design.
