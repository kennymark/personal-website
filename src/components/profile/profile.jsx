              a Software Engineer for Trelleborg Marine Systems and formerly a University of Chester graduate. I graduated with a Computer Science degree in CompSci but the web (front-end && backend) is where I live.  I love everything about UI design and UX on the web. I have worked on several projects including this website. I also develop and design mobile apps with React Native.

              I actively spend many hours per day working on my side projects which can be found on github code. I have developed applications for mobile, desktop and web both in their native languages or using cross-platform solutions. Software development aside, I am also heavily invested in the creation and nurturing of ideas that are used by the masses. I incline to be entrepreneurial at times and product design would be an area I would love to explore and competent at. I see beyond code and design.
